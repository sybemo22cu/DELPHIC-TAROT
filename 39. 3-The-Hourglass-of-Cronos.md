THE HOURGLASS OF CRONOS

Three-card spread – Past, Present, Future

Purpose: To reveal the temporal flow of a situation, uncovering its origin, its current moment, and the direction life is taking.


---

When to use it:

to understand the evolution of an event

to explore a karmic or emotional knot

to meditate on your path

to receive guidance for a choice or life transition



---

Procedure:

1. Shuffle the deck with presence and silence, as if breathing the essence of time into each card.


2. Lay out three cards vertically, forming a stylized hourglass.



Top: The Past Card
Middle: The Present Card
Bottom: The Future Card


---

Symbolic Reading:

The Past (top) is the point where the sands of time began to fall — memories, causes, inherited influences.
The Present (center) is the pressure point, where time narrows — the challenge, the moment of decision.
The Future (bottom) is the space about to be filled — potential, direction, ripening.


---

Philosophical Note:

Cronos is not only the time that devours, but also the one who guards the seed of renewal.
In this spread, each card flows into the next like sand through an hourglass: nothing is still — everything transforms.
