18 – THE MOON

Hero: Endymion
Symbol: Selene’s Crescent Moon


---

General Meaning

The Moon marks the subtle boundary between what is and what seems; it is the breath of the unconscious, the deep water of dreams where nothing is linear — yet everything whispers, warps, and hides.
With Endymion, this card becomes a hypnotic and silent chant, inviting the soul to descend into its own inner labyrinth, unafraid of the fog.

Keywords: illusion, dream, shadow, unconscious, mystery, allure, unveiling.

Card Description

At the center of the scene, Endymion lies asleep on an emerald-green meadow,
draped in a silvery robe that shimmers in the moonlight, as if his very body had become part of the dream.

He no longer touches the ground:

> "His body barely grazes the grass, suspended between worlds, like one who no longer belongs to waking life but has not yet crossed the threshold of darkness."



On his chest he wears a silver pendant shaped like a crescent moon, gently pulsing with light — the mark of his bond with Selene and the dream realm.

Selene – The Lady of Forgetting

In the sky, a full moon reigns, full and magnetic, radiating a soft glow — mother and queen of the unknown.
Within it, the ethereal face of Selene can be glimpsed, resting her hands on her chin, eyes fixed on Endymion.

> "She watches him with sweetness... but also with possession. The key to the dream is hers, and no one awakens without her consent."

Lycaon and Unicorn – The Shadow Guardians

At Endymion’s sides, two beings keep vigil:

To the left, Lycaon, with grayish fur and ember-red eyes.
He is primal instinct, repressed rage, desire for matter.
He is the inner wolf howling at the moon without understanding it.

To the right, the white Unicorn, radiant and serene, with a horn reflecting the moonlight.
He is pure dream, divine longing, innocence that still believes in miracles.

> "One growls, the other whispers. Both are real. Both are parts of you."

The Stream and the Mirror of Water

Near Endymion’s body flows a clear stream, reflecting the moon. But the reflection is slightly distorted, as if the water itself dreamed a different face.

> "In the stream, the moon splits, curves, transforms.
There, nothing is certain. There, truth dances in disguise."



White petals float on the water, carried by a silent breeze.


---

Background and Atmosphere

The sky is deep and dark blue, scattered with stars that move slowly, as if they too were dreaming.
The landscape is calm, yet filled with a silent magnetism.

A distant hill dissolves into mist, like a memory refusing to be grasped.

Iconographic Symbols

Lunar pendant: the bond with Selene, but also the gateway to dreaming.

Unicorn: the pure soul that dreams of the divine.

Lycaon: the shadowed, beastly part that fears the light.

Selene: goddess of enchantment and sacred illusion.

The stream: a liquid mirror, distorted truth.



---

Colors and Lighting

Silver: for robe, moon, unicorn, and reflections.

Dark gray and vivid red: for Lycaon and his shadows.

Deep green: for the meadow.

Midnight blue and violet: for the sky and water.


The entire scene is bathed in a muffled, lunar glow — not to illuminate, but to reveal what the mind cannot see.


---

Philosophical Elements

Endymion is the soul that chooses to sleep — or perhaps is chosen.

Selene is the sweet illusion that comforts but can also bind.

Lycaon and the Unicorn are the guardians of the dream, the extremes of consciousness.

The stream is the doorway to mystery, reflecting but never explaining.

Card Interpretation

Core Theme:
The Moon with Endymion is an invitation to enter one’s dream without demanding to understand, but with the humility to feel.
It is the card of doubt, confusion, and enchantment, for only in the maze of night can one meet the hidden part of the Self.

Universal Symbolism:
Every element — Selene, the stream, the Unicorn, Lycaon — mirrors the unconscious, calling the seeker inward, to a journey without certainty, but with the courage to listen.
