Card Description

Psyche is depicted standing in a serene landscape, poised with elegance and calm.
Her face is gentle and aware, her eyes lowered, as if listening to a silence deeper than sound.

She wears a long white gown, adorned on the chest with a golden circle enclosing a silver triangle:
a symbol of union between heaven and earth, between spirit and embodied soul.

In her hands she holds two amphorae, one silver (Moon) and one golden (Sun).
With a slow, harmonious gesture, she pours water from one into the other.

> “Psyche’s gesture has no beginning or end: she pours always and forever, as if the entire world depended on that delicate balance.”



The water flowing between the amphorae shimmers with iridescent, silvery reflections, like liquid mercury.

> “The flowing water glows with living silver, shifting its hues as if it held fragments of dream and silence.”



Behind her, two ethereal wings — not made of feathers, but of translucent waves of light.

> “Psyche’s wings are not made for flight, but for resonance: waves of light that open when the soul is at peace.”

Background and Atmosphere

The landscape is natural and harmonious: a quiet river flows, pastel-toned flowers bloom, and the sky is calm.
A warm, diffuse light pervades everything, blurring the line between body and soul, earth and sky.

> “All is in balance: nothing stands still, yet nothing is lost.”
