X – THE WHEEL

Heroes: Castor & Pollux

Symbol: The Scythe of Cronus


---

General Meaning

The Wheel represents the breath of destiny — the eternal motion between light and shadow, rise and fall.
With Castor and Pollux, the card becomes a cosmic dance of polarities: one descends, the other ascends, showing that nothing remains still in the tapestry of time.
To accept change is to embrace the cyclical wisdom of life — where every peak is fleeting, and every abyss a prelude to rebirth.

Keywords: Cycle, change, destiny, acceptance, flow.

Card Description

A great wheel rises at the center, suspended in space.
It is adorned with interwoven serpents and circular geometric patterns, evoking eternal time, return, and sacred cyclicality.

> “The wheel does not merely turn: it breathes the breath of destiny, swaying between ascent and descent.”



Castor, on the descending side:
His body leans forward, eyes heavy with fatigue.
A green serpent coils around his ankles.

> “The serpent doesn’t just restrain him: it whispers deceptive promises of easy glory, of pleasures that drown.”



He wears a simple drape, leaving his torso bare — bare before the cycles of life, defenseless against the fall.

Pollux, on the ascending side:
Stretched upward, eyes clear and inspired.
A golden eagle grips his arm with elegance, helping him rise.

> “The golden eagle not only lifts him: it teaches him to see beyond the clouds, to fly without fearing the height.”



He too wears a similar drape, but his body reaches for the light, for the sky that awaits him.

Background and Atmosphere

The wheel is suspended in a cosmic backdrop, scattered with eternal stars — a space beyond time, without direction.
A golden ray of light shines upon Pollux from above, while a deep blue shadow envelops Castor.

The Scythe of Cronus, ghostly and arched, curves across the background like an invisible arc of time — symbol of the force that governs all cycles.

Philosophical Elements

The cycle is sacred, not cruel: what rises must fall, and what falls will rise.

The serpent and eagle are not enemies, but teachers.

The twins do not fight — they are aspects of the same being, in different phases of the journey.

Interpretation of the Card

Central Theme:
The Wheel, through Castor and Pollux, reminds us that nothing is static — that true balance is not found in stillness, but in embracing motion as the essence of life.
Who falls today will rise tomorrow.
Who shines now will one day know the shadow.
To welcome the cycle is to welcome oneself.

Universal Symbolism:
Every detail — the wheel, the eagle, the serpent, the twins — reflects an eternal law:
There is no luck or misfortune, only the journey.
