Card Description

Hector is depicted hanging upside down, tied by the right ankle to a large tree with deep roots and branches stretching skyward.
He wears a white tunic that floats lightly upward — a symbol of purity and transcendence.
His face bears a serene, compassionate expression.

> “On Hector’s inverted face rests a faint smile — not of joy, but of compassion: he has already forgiven, even before being struck.”



Around his head glows a delicate aura, suggesting inner awakening and peace through sacrifice.

At the base of the tree, Paris kneels.
He holds the rope from which Hector hangs.
He wears a completely black garment, and his face reflects a tension of dual emotion: guilt and contemplation.

> “The rope in Paris’s hands does not rest still: it vibrates like a thread of destiny stretched between guilt and liberation.”



Among the tree’s roots, partially hidden, a split-open pomegranate reveals its vivid red seeds.

> “A symbol of fertility through pain, Persephone’s fruit reminds us that every sacrifice nourishes something not yet seen.”

A warm, golden light bathes Hector’s body, while Paris remains in shadow — caught between penance and awakening.

The tree from which Hector hangs is massive, ancient, marked with knots, natural carvings, and symbolic signs: a living bridge between earth and sky, between suffering and understanding.

Philosophical Elements

Sacrifice is fruitful: it transforms not only the one who makes it but also the one who observes and supports it.

Interpretation of the Card

Central Theme:
The Hanged Man, with Hector and Paris, represents sacred suspension — the moment when all stands still in order to transform.
It is an invitation to accept suffering not as punishment, but as a passage to new vision — an offering to becoming.

Universal Symbolism:
Every element — the rope, the tree, the light and shadow — reminds us that every sacrifice is also a birth.
Guilt, when lived consciously, can become a form of redemption for both the giver and the receiver.
