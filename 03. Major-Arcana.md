MAJOR ARCANA

Myth, Vision, and Transfiguration

The twenty-two Major Arcana of the Delphic Tarot are inspired by the archetypal core of traditional Tarot, yet they rewrite its forms and symbols through the lens of Greek mythology, the inner vision of the author, and a spiritual path lived in first person.

Each card is the face of an Idea — the symbolic expression of an eternal principle reflected in the human soul.
The Heroes and Goddesses, the symbols and landscapes, have been chosen not for historical accuracy, but for their spiritual resonance.

These Arcana do not merely speak of fate or destiny; they accompany the soul on a journey of transmutation:
from Chaos to Light, from the Unknown to the Self, from the Veil to the Heart.

Though inspired by the traditional steps of the Fool, the Magician, Death, the Sun… each card presents itself as a living and autonomous icon, connected to a poetic and initiatory world where mythology is not fiction, but the memory of the soul.

> “The Major Arcana open the path.
The Minor Arcana tell its details, its secrets, its daily shadows.”
