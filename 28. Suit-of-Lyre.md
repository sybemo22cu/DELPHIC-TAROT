The melody vibrates in the air, visible as luminous waves spreading across the clear sky.

TWO OF LYRE

Hero: Tiresias
Keywords: Doubt, balance, inner listening, duality, subtle discernment

Card Description:
Tiresias sits on a smooth stone, eyes closed. His face is serene yet profound, marked by the wisdom born of silence and blindness. One hand holds a knotted staff, the other rests open on his lap, attuned to the invisible world.
To his left, a young musician plays Apollo’s golden seven-string lyre—clear, orderly, radiant. A red sun sets behind the columns of Olympus.
To his right, an older musician plays Orpheus’ silver nine-string lyre—soft, melancholic, dreamlike. A crescent moon rises in a deepening blue sky.

Symbolic Message:
When the mind falls silent, the heart hears what the senses miss.
Between reason and inspiration, light and dream, lies the deeper truth.
Like Tiresias, listen between the notes of silence: the answer lies not in deciding, but in understanding.

THREE OF LYRE

Heroine: Sappho
Keywords: Broken heart, regret, memory, resilience

Card Description:
On sun-cracked, barren ground, Sappho sits with lowered gaze and a veil of sadness. Three lyres lie nearby: two shattered completely, one with torn strings; the third, centered, has a single intact string glowing faintly—one last note lingering in silence.
She wears a simple yet elegant dress and holds a hand over her heart, as if containing a deep emotion that cannot speak.

Symbolic Message:
Not all is lost. Even when the music breaks, a single string can still sing.
Pain does not erase beauty—it transforms it.
Wounds may become poetry.

FOUR OF LYRE

Hero: Cronos
Keywords: Rest, suspension, mental harmony, inner time

Card Description:
Cronos sits on a cosmic throne suspended among stars. His eyes are closed, his face peaceful.
To his right rests the scythe, symbol of time and its suspension.
To his left, a clear hourglass stands empty—time has paused.
Above him, four ethereal lyres float in silent accord. No hand plays them, yet they hum with nourishing harmony.
They are the dream of Cronos—and the pulsing heart of his rest.

Symbolic Message:
Even time retreats when harmony reigns.
This card teaches that silence holds the deepest music, and that true power is born of conscious pause.

FIVE OF LYRE

Hero: Arion
Keywords: Mental conflict, inner dissonance, fragmentation, reflection

Card Description:
Arion sits in a softly undulating chamber, as if shaped by solidified sound.
The lyre rests on his knees, untouched. His hands clutch his head, elbows on thighs—a gesture of tension.
Around him, four mirrored versions of himself each play the lyre differently: one with fervor, one with sadness, one indifferently, one joyfully.
Each represents an inner voice.
Their silent melodies blend into a fractured harmony, each trying to dominate the other.

Symbolic Message:
The Five of Lyre speaks of inner dissonance.
When our inner voices play different chords, conflict arises.
But by patiently listening to each one, a new, chosen harmony can emerge.

SIX OF LYRE

Hero: Orpheus
Keywords: Inner healing, mental harmony, passage, silent relief

Card Description:
Orpheus sits on a small boat gliding across calm waters at dusk.
The lyre rests on his lap, fingers brushing its strings in an ethereal melody.
The boat has no oars or rudder—it is guided by the lyre’s magical vibration, like sound turned to wind.
Six lyres line the boat’s edges, each distinct in shape, color, and design—six harmonized thoughts.
Orpheus gazes at the brightening sky. Behind him, distant rocks fade. Ahead, a soft horizon opens.

Symbolic Message:
When the mind is at peace, the crossing becomes gentle.
Orpheus plays not to move gods, but to heal himself.
The sound of his lyre guides the boat like a subtle breath—carrying the soul beyond doubt to shores of clarity.

SEVEN OF LYRE

Hero: Autolycus
Keywords: Deception, strategy, cunning, double mind

Card Description:
In a misty night landscape, Autolycus walks stealthily on a rocky path.
A dark lyre hides under his cloak—its strings intact but silent, as if the sound had been stolen.
He looks back—not with fear, but calculation.
Behind him, two golden lyres lie on an altar; before him, he carries four more, stolen with skill.
Feathers, dry leaves, and a cracked mirror lie scattered—air symbols marking trickery.

Symbolic Message:
The Seven of Lyre is the card of conscious deceit.
When the mind is sharp as a blade, truth becomes blurred.
But beware: the cunning that protects may also imprison. Discernment is the key.

EIGHT OF LYRE

Heroine: Eurydice
Keywords: Mental prison, memory, unresolved bond, regret, discernment

Card Description:
In the heart of Hades, wrapped in dense silence, stands the marble statue of Eurydice.
Her half-closed eyes and serene face hover between dream and waiting.
Around her, eight suspended lyres form a circle. Seven are dull, inert—relics of broken harmony.
Only one, behind her, glows faintly with silver light—its strings gently vibrating, like a song yearning to be born again.

Symbolic Message:
The Eight of Lyre is the prison of the unseen: the mind trapped in memory and silent sorrow.
Yet one string still vibrates.
Discernment, conscious choice, can break the spell.
The exit exists—if we listen deeply enough.

NINE OF LYRE

Hero: Amphiaraus
Keywords: Nightmares, mental torment, insomnia, prophetic visions, spiritual solitude

Card Description:
Amphiaraus sits on a circular rock within a cave, his body bent forward, hands gripping his hair, face hidden.
Around him, nine floating lyres circle: eight are dark, their tense strings vibrating with dissonant tones, as if possessed by invisible force.
Only one, behind him, is pearlescent, its strings glowing gold—a way out, a harmony still waiting to be heard.
Moonlight filters through a crack in the stone floor, a sign of hope rising in darkness.

Symbolic Message:
The Nine of Lyre depicts mental oppression—obsessive thoughts, the dark night of the soul.
Yet even in the deepest nightmare, one lyre hums with silent healing.
It’s the soul’s voice, inviting restoration.
Will you turn and listen?

TEN OF LYRE

Hero: Uranus
Keywords: Violent end, fall of power, cosmic rebirth, collapse of harmony

Card Description:
Uranus falls through the night sky, his colossal body spiraling through clouds, wind, and stars.
He is naked, wrapped in a fading mantle of light—the echo of a vanishing era.
Ten shattered lyres circle him like broken constellations, each string snapped or twisted.
Some produce chaotic sound—cries of a wounded cosmos.
Below, Gaia watches with severe yet compassionate gaze. Her hands are open—she does not punish or grasp, but receives.

Symbolic Message:
When harmony collapses, pain and truth emerge together.
The fall of Uranus is not only destruction—it is the beginning of a new order.
When the mind yields, a path may open toward deeper consciousness.
