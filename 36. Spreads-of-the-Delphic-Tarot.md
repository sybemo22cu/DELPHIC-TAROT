SPREADS OF THE DELPHIC TAROT

Some of the spreads in the Delphic Tarot are inspired by traditional layouts, reimagined through a mythical and mystical lens. Others are entirely original — born from intuitive design to offer deep, symbolic insight.

Each spread explores a different level of the self and of the soul.
