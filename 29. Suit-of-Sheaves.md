SUIT OF SHEAVES

ACE OF SHEAVES

Heroine: Demeter

Keywords: Nourishment, abundance, earth, cycles

Card Description:
Demeter stands at the heart of a golden wheat field, bathed in the warm light of the setting sun.
She wears a long flowing green silk dress, blending harmoniously with the landscape.
Her long brown hair is tied in a simple green cloth knot, symbol of balance and humility.
In her right hand, she holds an extraordinary golden sheaf, almost as tall as she is, touching the sky.
The surrounding wheat sways gently, as if breathing in her presence.

Abundance is born from respect for Earth’s rhythms.
This Ace is a call to grounding, simplicity, and gratitude for what sustains life.
It’s not about accumulation, but about recognizing the sacred gift of cycles: what grows, also nourishes the soul.

TWO OF SHEAVES

Heroes: Amphion & Zethus

Keywords: Balance, cooperation, grounding, complementarity

Card Description:
On a green hilltop, two golden sheaves grow on opposite sides of a central sacred stone. One bends slightly toward the other, as if in silent dialogue.
Before each sheaf sits one of the twin brothers: Amphion on the left, dressed in light clothes with a lyre beside him; Zethus on the right, shirtless, holding a chisel.
Both gaze at the stone, where a spiral-shaped labyrinth is carved.

Symbolic Message:
Stability arises when action and contemplation work together.
The sheaves do not compete for growth: they draw from the same soil.
Likewise, prosperity is found in harmony between differing intentions.

THREE OF SHEAVES

Heroine: Cybele

Keywords: Collaboration, labor, shared fruit, harmonious building

Card Description:
Under the warm sunlight in a golden field, three farmers—two men and a woman—work together in perfect harmony.
Each is engaged in a different task: one harvests, one binds sheaves, the other gathers fallen stalks.
In the background, Cybele watches calmly and attentively. She wears a deep green dress, symbolizing fertility and her bond with the earth, and raises three golden sheaves in blessing.

Symbolic Message:
To build something solid requires many hands, hearts in tune, and respect for nature’s cycles.
True wealth arises when each person offers their part, and the earth responds with generosity.

FOUR OF SHEAVES

Hero: Pan

Keywords: Possession, grounding, preservation, attachment

Card Description:
Pan sits on a stone stool at the edge of a ripened grain field.
With one hand, he grips a golden sheaf tightly, wanting to keep it for himself.
His usually playful face is now serious and focused, eyes fixed on his treasure.
Behind him, three sheaves still stand untouched in the waving wheat, while the one in his hand appears wilted, its vitality fading.

Symbolic Message:
Clinging to what we love can sometimes drain its life.
True richness flows through letting go, nurturing, and sharing.
This card invites reflection on what we hold onto, and what we fear to lose.

FIVE OF SHEAVES

Heroes: Philemon & Baucis

Keywords: Loss, trial, hidden hope, solidarity

Card Description:
On cracked and arid ground, Philemon and Baucis sit close together, wrapped in worn mantles.
His face is bowed, marked by fatigue; hers shows gentle sorrow, eyes seeking comfort in his.
Around them, four wilted sheaves lie scattered—dry, broken—symbols of lost resources and dimmed hopes.
Behind them stands a crumbling stone house: a half-open door, shattered windows, signs of abandonment.
But through one window shines a fifth golden sheaf, glowing in the shadows—silent grace awaiting discovery.

Symbolic Message:
Even in the heart of lack, a quiet light remains.
Hope is not always found outside: sometimes it dwells beside us, in a gaze that supports us, in a loyalty that endures desolation.

SIX OF SHEAVES

Hero: Priam

Keywords: Generosity, justice, exchange, support, responsibility

Card Description:
Before the walls of Troy, Priam stands on a low step, offering a golden sheaf to a young kneeling citizen.
Five others—men and women of various ages—wait in line, eyes filled with trust.
Next to Priam, on a low stone altar, lie five more golden sheaves, carefully arranged.
He wears a regal tunic of deep red and gold, his face aged with wisdom.
The city walls behind him symbolize protective order: the exchange happens within shared stability.

Symbolic Message:
Those who have harvested must also give back.
True wealth is born from sharing; true sovereignty from the ability to nourish.
To give fairly is the first mark of a noble heart.

SEVEN OF SHEAVES

Hero: Aristaeus

Keywords: Waiting, ripening, perseverance, hope, fruit of labor

Card Description:
In a golden meadow, Aristaeus sits on the ground in a posture of calm waiting.
He gazes serenely at a large tree bearing mature wheat sheaves that sway in the breeze.
Dressed in a simple sand-colored tunic, with tied-back hair and a face shaped by experience,
he rests his hands on his knees in patient trust.
At his feet lie his tools: a sickle, an empty sack, a wooden hoe.
Seven golden sheaves gleam among the branches, ripe yet unharvested.

Symbolic Message:
You have sown, you have worked. Now comes the waiting.
The harvest cannot be rushed—it ripens in silence.
True power lies in trust, consistency, and letting time do its sacred work.

EIGHT OF SHEAVES

Hero: Icarius

Keywords: Waiting, patience, dedication, quiet maturation

Card Description:
Icarius sits before a grand grain tree in the heart of a golden field.
His hands rest on his knees, body relaxed in contemplation.
At his feet, a hoe lies abandoned—the work is done.
Beside him, a terracotta jar holds seven perfectly preserved sheaves, carefully arranged.
From the tree’s highest branch hangs an eighth sheaf, still swaying, not yet plucked.

Symbolic Message:
You have cultivated with care, and the fruits are visible.
But don’t rush the final act—what is nearly ready needs its own perfect moment.
Real strength lies in conscious waiting.

NINE OF SHEAVES

Heroine: Rhea

Keywords: Fulfillment, gratitude, abundance, inner peace

Card Description:
Rhea, mother of the gods, stands in a flowering field bathed in golden sunlight.
She wears an amber-colored dress that blends with the fertile earth.
In her left hand, she holds a ripe sheaf—symbol of gratitude and completion—
while a white dove rests on her right shoulder, messenger of peace.
Two more doves soar in the serene sky.
On either side, two golden wheat trees rise, each bearing four full sheaves.
Her lips curve in a soft smile—she knows nothing is perfect, yet all can be lived in fullness.

Symbolic Message:
The Nine of Sheaves honors the beauty of simple things and the harvest of one’s path.
But even in peace, there is memory of toil, and the wisdom to cherish every gift.
True abundance is born of gratitude.

TEN OF SHEAVES

Heroine: Hestia

Keywords: Wholeness, peace, fulfillment, gratitude, grounding

Card Description:
Hestia sits on a large stone among tall golden grasses in a peaceful rural scene.
She wears a simple cream dress with golden highlights and a light mantle draped over her shoulders.
Her bare feet touch the earth—symbol of her bond with humanity.
In her hands, she holds a golden sheaf, gazing at it with serene joy, as if listening to the voice of the land.
Around her, nine sheaves rest naturally on the grass like quiet offerings.
Nearby, two hares and a deer observe her in stillness.
The sun sets low on the horizon, bathing everything in gentle, reassuring light.
In the distance, simple homes with smoking chimneys hint at the world’s acceptance of her gift.

Symbolic Message:
The cycle is complete.
Hestia has left Olympus to live among humans, carrying the sacred fire of hearth and heart.
The Sheaf, now fully ripe, represents abundance born from ego renunciation and simplicity.
There is nothing more to seek: happiness is already here, if we know how to see it.
