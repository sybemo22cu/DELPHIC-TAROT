---

General Meaning

The Hierophant represents the voice of the sacred — the transmission of knowledge that bridges earth and sky.
With Asclepius, the card becomes a living bridge between the visible and the invisible: he is the master who heals not only the body, but the soul, through silence, harmony, and initiatic wisdom.
He is the hand that teaches without imposing, the heart that remembers the eternal laws.

Keywords: Wisdom, spiritual guidance, tradition, divine connection, teaching.

Card Description

Asclepius is depicted at the top of a sacred staircase, with a calm and majestic posture.
He wears a white tunic, symbol of purity, and a violet cloak, emblem of higher wisdom.
His long, flowing hair enhances his hieratic aura, as though time no longer touches him.

In his right hand, he holds the Rod of Asclepius, around which a living serpent coils, gazing into his eyes.

> “The serpent does not sleep: it watches Asclepius like an ancient ally, a silent keeper of the secret.”



On either side of the staircase rise two columns, one white and one black: symbols of duality and balance.
On one column, the caduceus is carved — a seal of sacred knowledge.

The steps are adorned with the symbols of the four elements:

At the top: Fire (right) and Air (left) — masculine energies.

At the bottom: Water (right) and Earth (left) — feminine energies.
The arrangement represents the ascent from material unconsciousness to spiritual clarity.


Two kneeling disciples are at the base of the staircase — one in white, one in black.

> “They receive no words. Each absorbs the wisdom through their own silence. One understands time, the other form.”

Background and Atmosphere

Behind Asclepius stands an open temple, its wide doors symbolizing accessible divine knowledge.
From within flows a warm and gentle light that caresses the scene without blinding.

> “It is a light that does not dazzle, but wraps like a mute chant, as if truth had a voice that need not be heard.”



Inside the temple are glimpses of sacred healing and wisdom: a chalice, a lyre, ancient scrolls.
The sky above is clear, tinged with gold — like at sunset — evoking timeless serenity.
