The Delphic Tarot is no ordinary deck.
It was not born to predict, but to remember.
Each Arcana is a threshold, each image a reflection of the Soul in the mirror of Myth.
Here, the figures of Greek tradition do not merely embody ancient stories,
but become inner principles, initiatory trials, archetypal forms.

From the Fool–Aeneas fleeing burning Troy,
to Europa ascending upon the back of the divine Bull,
this deck is a journey of Being:
an Odyssey of the Spirit, a bridge between the human and the divine,
between earth and ether.

These Tarot cards can be used for divination, like any oracle deck,
but their true purpose is subtler:
to accompany the esoteric path, stimulate inner knowledge,
and nourish the alchemical work each of us carries within.

Each card is built with the precision of symbol,
but breathes with the subtle breath of Mystery.
Each character — hero, heroine, beast or god — carries a teaching,
a challenge, a threshold to be crossed.

This Tarot does not offer immediate answers.
It whispers.
It teaches the art of waiting, of deep listening,
of contemplating what lies beneath the surface.

They can be read.
But they can also be meditated upon, scrutinized, dreamed.

Whether you are a seeker, an artist, or a pilgrim of the Invisible,
these cards will lead you where language falls silent:
among the symbols of the Soul
and the silent laws of the universe.

Welcome to the Temple of Delphi.
Here, nothing is foretold — everything is heard.
