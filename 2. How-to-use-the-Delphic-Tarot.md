HOW TO USE THE DELPHIC TAROT

The Delphic Tarot can be used in various ways, depending on your intent and the depth you wish to explore.

## 1. Symbolic Divination

For those seeking insight in the present moment, it is possible to draw one card per day or ask a specific question.  
The answer will never be direct, but revealed through the archetypal image and its inner meaning.  
What emerges is what already lives within you — simply waiting to be seen.

## 2. Inner Meditation

Each Arcana can be contemplated like an initiatory mandala.  
Gaze at the image. Close your eyes.  
Let the symbol work within you, without haste.  
What resonates in your body, your heart, your mind?  
Which part of you is speaking through that hero, that goddess, that threshold?

## 3. Alchemical Work

You can use these Tarot cards as tools of transmutation.  
An Arcana that repeats, that haunts you, that fascinates you...  
is no accident: it mirrors your **Opus Nigra** or **Opus Alba**.  
Take notes. Reflect. Transform.  
Each card may serve as a key to face inner trials, ancient wounds, or latent potential.

## 4. Narrative or Dreamlike Reading

You can lay out three, five, or seven Arcana to form a symbolic story.  
Like in a dream, allow the images to speak to each other.  
What myth is being told through your present moment?  
What does the Invisible wish to reveal, in the form of a personal legend?

### Final Note

It is not the seeker who chooses the card.  
It is the card that calls the seeker — when the time has come.
