PAGE OF LYRE

Hero: Dionysus

Keywords: Ecstasy, inspiration, creative communication, musical impulse, spontaneous revelation

Card Description:
Dionysus is depicted seated on a smooth stone among vines and wildflowers, at the edge of a sacred forest.
He wears an open purple cloak, and his curly hair is adorned with grape leaves. A subtle golden aura surrounds him.
In his hands, he holds a living lyre, grown like a flowering branch: its strings are made of braided gold and vibrate on their own, sending waves of light through the air.
He is not playing — the lyre plays for him, resonating with the beats of his heart.
The invisible melody seems to attract small animals and spirits of nature.
At his feet, a snake coils among the roots — a symbol of revelation and cyclic renewal.
Behind him, an altar with ancient inscriptions hints at Dionysian mysteries blending word, sound, and trance.

Symbolic Message:
The Page of Lyre is the inspired messenger, one who allows music and speech to arise without control.
Dionysus does not command the instrument — the instrument speaks through him.
This card invites you to communicate through the soul, to create without effort, and to trust the inner song that guides you beyond logic.
