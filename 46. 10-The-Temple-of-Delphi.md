THE TEMPLE OF DELPHI

Ten-card spread – Vertical Column of Ascent

This spread is the initiatory heart of the Delphi Tarot deck. Inspired by the ideal structure of a sacred temple, it accompanies the querent through a symbolic journey from the material plane to the spiritual, reflecting the various levels of the self.

Each card represents a column, a threshold, or a plane of experience. Arranged in a vertical axis, the ten cards tell the story of a passage from the earthly entrance to the inner summit.

It can be used for deep, cyclical readings, moments of transition, life reviews, or paths of self-revelation.
It is recommended to shuffle the entire deck (Majors and Minors), and optionally to perform the Cut of Hermes, using the cut card as “The Temple Gate” — the first message that opens the journey.

Usage Tip:

Take your time to listen to each card in its level.
You may read the whole temple from top to bottom, from bottom to top, or let the moment guide the order.

In the Temple of Delphi,
each card is a column of the soul,
each position, a room of silence,
each message, a sacred echo waiting only for your listening.
