TORCH FIGURES

PAGE OF TORCH

Hero: Thanatos

Keywords: Young fire, initiation, mystery, silent transformation

Card Description:
Thanatos, youthful and solemn, stands in a twilight clearing.
He wears a long black tunic edged with deep blue, gently swaying in the wind.
His eyes are closed, his expression serene and distant, as if listening to inner voices.
In his right hand, he holds a blue-flamed torch, burning without smoke — a subtle, spiritual fire.
Its light does not illuminate the surroundings but reflects inward.
Behind him, a path winds through the trees, marked by small floating blue flames: symbols of souls, trials to face, or forgotten memories.

Symbolic Message:
The Page of Torch is the initiate, approaching the power of Fire for the first time.
He does not control it, nor fear it — he carries it with respect and silence.
His blue flame does not burn the world: it awakens it.
Thanatos brings not death, but awareness. He is the messenger who introduces us to the path of inner renewal.

KNIGHT OF TORCH

Hero: Charon

Keywords: Transition, guidance in darkness, passage, fire of initiation

Card Description:
Charon is depicted in his boat, gliding silently over the dark waters of the Underworld.
He wears a black cloak with shadowy reflections, his face partly hidden beneath a hood.
In his right hand, he holds a long oar engraved with ancient symbols.
Fastened to the boat’s side is a torch with a blue flame, lighting the path through the mist.
Beside him sits a vague soul-shaped figure, wrapped in ethereal vapors — faceless, only a contour of light: a symbol of the soul in transit.

Symbolic Message:
The Knight of Torch guides through the passage between worlds — between the known and the unknown.
He does not fight: he crosses.
His torch does not burn to destroy, but to show the way through the night of the soul.

QUEEN OF TORCH

Heroine: Persephone

Keywords: Transformation, hidden power, light in shadow, inner sovereignty

Card Description:
Persephone sits upon her throne of shadow and light, in a silent hall deep in the Underworld.
Her long black hair flows gently over her shoulders, framing a calm and deep expression.
She wears a violet gown with golden trim, soft as velvet, conveying the nobility of her role.
A slender golden crown rests on her head. In her left hand, she holds an engraved pomegranate — symbol of her bond with the underworld and inner mysteries.
In her right, a torch with a broken flame — half red, half blue — lights the scene: the fire of transformation, burning in the twilight of the soul.

Symbolic Message:
The Queen of Torch guards the secret of return.
She has known initiatory death and reigns wisely over what must transform.
She is the guide in darkness, the sovereign who welcomes pain and turns it into light.

KING OF TORCH

Hero: Hades

Keywords: Sovereignty, inner dominion, transformative power, hidden authority

Card Description:
Hades sits upon his throne of black stone, carved with flame and shadow reliefs, deep within his realm.
He wears a black tunic trimmed in crimson. His long gray hair and beard frame a stern yet composed face.
A golden crown with slender ethereal flames rises from his head.
In his right hand, he holds the bident — symbol of regal power over the Underworld.
In his left, he bears a torch whose flame radiates both light and shadow.
Around the throne, the earth is cracked with glowing fissures. Shadows of souls encircle him, none daring to approach too closely: his presence commands respect and silence.

Symbolic Message:
The King of Torch is no tyrant, but one who has mastered the fire of the depths.
He transforms pain into strength, darkness into knowledge, and teaches us to reign over ourselves before seeking to lead others.
