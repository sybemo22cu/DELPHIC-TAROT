General Meaning

The Chariot represents mastery over inner forces, the will that drives forward motion, and victory achieved through balance.
With Bellerophon, the card becomes sacred ascent and tension: he embodies the hero who flies high, suspended between glory and risk, between control and instinct.
It is the power that advances — but only when guided by the heart and the discipline of spirit.

Keywords: Victory, movement, control, determination, ambition.

Card Description

Bellerophon is depicted at the center, leading a golden chariot in flight, its wheels wrapped in radiant flames.
He wears a silver armor and a cloak of golden feathers — symbols of glory and spiritual purity.

In his right hand, he holds a sharp spear, emblem of the triumphant warrior and the will that pierces through obstacles.

His gaze is fixed on the horizon, but a crease between his brows betrays the strain of control:

> “He knows that losing balance now would mean falling from far too high.”

The Chariot and the Pegasi

The chariot is adorned with engravings of Ares’ red helmet.
Its wheels emit flames — symbols of motion and celestial energy.
Sun and moon symbols appear on its frame, in perfect harmony.

Before the chariot fly two Pegasi:

White Pegasus (to the right): pure, majestic, leading with calm and grace.

Black Pegasus (to the left): wild, powerful, blazing like untamed instinct.


> “The chariot doesn’t fly on its own: every breath, every muscle guides the Pegasi, as if victory were a thread stretched between sky and will.”



The two winged horses pull in slightly different directions, symbolizing the challenge of controlling opposing forces.

Background and Atmosphere

The sky is vast, with gradients of deep blue and golden light — either dawn or dusk, a moment of transition between two worlds.

Below, on the earth, lies the defeated Chimera: the monstrous body is still, yet its face retains a fierce expression.

> “The Chimera lies beneath the chariot, but its half-open eyes say that trials never die — they transform.”

Iconographic Symbols

The white and black Pegasi: duality, inner forces to be mastered.

Flaming wheels: energy, fire of spiritual journey.

Sun and moon symbols: harmony between day and night, mind and body.

Colors and Lighting

Gold and silver for the chariot and armor: nobility, heavenly triumph.

White and black for the Pegasi: dynamic balance between light and shadow.

Blue, orange, and crimson in the sky: movement, transition, elevation.

Slanting light on Bellerophon, shadow on the Chimera: light prevails, but does not erase.

Philosophical Elements

The Pegasi: forces of the psyche — the wild and the disciplined parts must cooperate.

The Chimera: inner monsters are not destroyed, but integrated or transcended through will and discernment.

The flight: not an escape, but an ascent — and every altitude requires a steady heart.

Interpretation of the Card

Central Theme:
The Chariot symbolizes triumph achieved through inner discipline.
Bellerophon shows us that victory is not static — it is a continuous act of lucid will, a flight maintained through mastery over one’s deepest forces.

Universal Symbolism:
Every element — from the Pegasi to the Chimera, from the sky to the chariot — reinforces the theme of control, direction, and the transformation of conflict into ascending power.
