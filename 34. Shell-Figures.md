SHELL FIGURES

PAGE OF SHELL

Hero: Glaucus

Keywords: Emerging emotion, wonder, sensitivity, transformation, intuitive awakening

Card Description:
Glaucus stands on a cliff bathed by the ocean, his body caught in transformation: his human legs gradually turning into a scaled tail, his hair tossed by the salty wind, and his skin glowing with marine hues of blue and green.
In his hands, he holds an iridescent shell, listening to it as if it were an oracle. A soft light glows from within — a symbol of the inner mystery just awakened.
His gaze is turned toward the horizon, full of wonder and confusion, like someone who has just discovered they belong to a new and unknown world.
Behind him, gentle waves rise and caress the rock, as if inviting him to dive in. A starfish rests on his foot — a fragile but inevitable sign of his bond with the water realm.

Symbolic Message:
The Page of Shell is the heart’s calling — the beginning of an emotional journey that transforms, even when it frightens.
Glaucus is not yet sure who he is, but he knows he must follow the call of intuition.
The shell he listens to is the voice of the depths: it does not lie, but it speaks a language only the soul can understand.
This card invites you to welcome sensitivity, even when it feels unstable, and to let yourself be guided by mystery. Every emotion is a wave leading to new shores.

KNIGHT OF SHELL

Hero: Triton

Keywords: Emotional momentum, inner journey, protection, call from the deep

Card Description:
Triton advances with majesty atop a giant seahorse, its body gleaming and fins translucent.
He wears a fluid armor made of coral, pearls, and scales, shining beneath the refracted light of the sea.
In his right hand, he holds a large spiraled shell, from which a mysterious sound emerges — able to calm storms and awaken lost memories.
The sound ripples out in soft circles across the ocean’s surface.
Around him, marine creatures swim in harmony: dolphins, rays, glowing jellyfish — symbols of the balance between guidance and emotional flow.
His gaze is serious, aware of his responsibility to protect what is fragile.
In the background, a submerged cliff reveals the ruins of ancient temples — echoes of an emotional past leaving traces to decipher.

Symbolic Message:
The Knight of Shell is the force that steers emotion — the courage to cross inner waters without sinking, but carrying awareness instead.
Triton does not flee from feelings: he faces them, rides them, and turns them into allies.
His shell is not only a weapon, but the voice of an ancient soul guiding the path toward healing and authentic love.

Card Description:
Amphitrite is seated on a throne of rose coral set among shells and seaweed, in the heart of a majestic and silent ocean floor.

KING OF SHELL

Hero: Poseidon

Keywords: Emotional authority, mastery of the depths, intuitive power, deep guidance

Card Description:
Poseidon stands among the waves, his solemn gaze fixed on the horizon.
His long black hair and flowing beard sway in the sea breeze.

In his right hand, he holds his golden trident, pointed toward the sky.
In his left, a dark blue shell emits a faint glow — the wisdom of the deep made visible.
At his feet, the water calms with each step, and the creatures of the sea — dolphins, fish, sea serpents — watch him in silent reverence.

Symbolic Message:
The King of Shell represents mastery over emotion and the steady guidance across inner seas.
Poseidon embodies the kind of authority that does not fear the depths, but inhabits them with respect and resolve.
He is the power of one who has learned not to be overwhelmed by the storm, but to sail through it with a steadfast heart.
