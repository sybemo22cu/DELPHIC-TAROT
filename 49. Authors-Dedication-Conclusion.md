 AUTHOR’S DEDICATION – CONCLUSION

To those who walk, to those who remember, to those who dream.

This deck was not born from a sudden spark,
but from a long path traced through myth, soul, and inner memory.

The Tarot of Delphi is my offering:
not a closed system, not a dogma,
but a mythical garden where each symbol breathes.
I wrote them with the voice of my nights,
I saw them rise from my dreams,
I forged them as one forges a blade: with silence, with fire, with love.

Each card is a reflection, each hero a call.
Each spread is a doorway:
to the ancient heart of being,
to that part of you with no name but deep listening.

If even one card speaks to you,
if even one image helps you remember who you are,
then this work has already fulfilled its journey.

I do not ask you to believe.
I ask you to enter, to see, and to remain in listening.
The Tarot of Delphi do not seek to guide you.
They observe you. They listen to you. They wait for you.
