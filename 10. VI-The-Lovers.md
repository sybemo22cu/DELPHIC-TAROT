Card Description

Jason is depicted at the center, his face turned toward Medea, but his body oriented toward Atalanta — symbolizing his inner conflict and indecision.

He wears a Greek-style robe in neutral tones, representing his uncertain state of mind and his vulnerability to external influences.

Medea, on the right, with long black hair and a bright red dress, embodies temptation and passion.
At her feet, a viper slithers out from beneath her robe — a symbol of hidden danger.
In her left hand, she holds a wooden staff crowned with a bright red gem; in her right, she offers a golden apple — symbol of deceptive choice and the allure of the forbidden.

> “The golden apple in Medea’s hand shines brighter than the sun — but the most seductive light is always the one that deceives.”



Atalanta, on the left, gazes upward toward the sky — a symbol of virtue and true direction.
She wears a Greek huntress outfit, light and practical, and holds a bow with a golden arrow aimed at the sun — pointing to the luminous and righteous path.
