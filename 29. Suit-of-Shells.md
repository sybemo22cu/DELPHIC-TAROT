SUIT OF SHELLS

ACE OF SHELLS

Heroine: Aphrodite

Keywords: Beauty, rebirth, emotion, sacred desire

Card Description:
At the heart of the Ocean, a large mother-of-pearl shell is open, suspended among calm waves.
Inside, Aphrodite lies gracefully, her right arm bent to support her tilted head, her magnetic gaze meeting the observer.
She wears only a white veil loosely draped over her hips, leaving her chest bare — a symbol of purity, truth, and seductive power.
Her long blond hair blends with the water, shining like golden seaweed. Around her, droplets of the sea float like tiny suspended pearls.

Symbolic Message:
Beauty is not mere form — it is presence born from within.
This Ace invites you to open to emotional life with innocence and awareness, letting authentic desire rise — the one that connects us to the soul and creation.

TWO OF SHELLS

Heroes: Acis & Galatea

Keywords: Union, mutual love, exchange, recognition, emotional balance

Card Description:
On a thin stretch of sand between the ocean and the rocks, Galatea and Acis face each other tenderly.
Galatea, with tied-up hair and a light dress, offers a pink shell with both hands; Acis, a young shepherd dressed in pale tones, presents her with a sky-blue shell.
Their eyes meet in silence. Behind them, waves gently kiss the shore, while the sky mirrors the intensity of their encounter.
All is still — as if the water itself held its breath, witnessing a bond born of reciprocity and listening.

Symbolic Message:
Two souls recognize each other and exchange their secret language.
The shell becomes the heart offered to the other — not to possess, but to share.
It is in the mutual gesture that the harmony of love is born.

THREE OF SHELLS

Heroines: The Three Charites (Aglaea, Euphrosyne, Thalia)

Keywords: Shared joy, harmony, celebration, beauty, spiritual union

Card Description:
On a golden sandy shore touched by gentle waves, the Three Charites dance in a circle.
Each holds an open shell from which luminous pearls flow into the sea, merging with the waves.
Aglaea (Splendor) wears a pearly pink dress, Euphrosyne (Joy) a sheer azure veil, and Thalia (Blooming) a crown of corals and shells woven into her copper hair.
Their arms brush softly, and their bare feet raise sparks of light from the water.

Symbolic Message:
When hearts are in harmony, even water sings.
This card celebrates the joy that comes from giving without expectation, from being present for one another.
Shared emotions amplify and purify, merging like pearls in the ocean of the soul.

FOUR OF SHELLS

Heroes: Calypso & Odysseus

Keywords: Reflection, emotional stagnation, missed opportunity, introspection, temptation

Card Description:
Odysseus sits on the sand, eyes closed, his face serious, lost in thought.
Before him lie three shells placed in a circle — symbols of past experiences, known desires now void of meaning.
Beside him, Calypso leans gracefully, her body wrapped in soft palm leaves, offering him a fourth shell, larger and more radiant, gleaming in the sunset light.
Yet Odysseus does not see it — imprisoned by his silence.

Symbolic Message:
Sometimes the soul is so caught in the past or inner reflection that it fails to recognize the gift being offered.
The Four of Shells invites us to discern between introspection and escape, between reflection and withdrawal — and to notice beauty when it knocks, even if we weren’t looking for it.

FIVE OF SHELLS

Heroine: Ariadne

Keywords: Loss, abandonment, regret, resilience

Card Description:
On a cliff overlooking a stormy ocean, Ariadne kneels with her gaze fixed on the horizon.
She wears a simple dress, ruffled by the wind, her hair loose and wild in the sea breeze.
At her feet lie three broken shells — symbols of shattered promises.
Not far off, two intact shells glimmer in the morning light, hinting that not all is lost.
Behind her, waves crash against the rocks — echoing her inner turmoil.

Symbolic Message:
The pain of abandonment can blind us — but not all is broken.
Sometimes hope lies in the fragments that remain, and in the strength to rise again with grace.

SIX OF SHELLS

Hero: Nausicaa

Keywords: Innocence, heart memory, gift, kindness, gentle return

Card Description:
Nausicaa sits on a smooth rock beside a spring that flows into the ocean.
Around her, five shells are laid on the grass — fragments of memories scattered by time.
The sixth shell rests in her hands, luminous with mother-of-pearl shimmer.
She gazes at it tenderly, as if it contained a distant voice.
She wears a soft peach-colored dress, her hair loose in the sea breeze.
In the background, a silent ship disappears on the horizon — like a memory.

Symbolic Message:
Not everything that leaves is lost.
Every act of love leaves its imprint on the heart.
Shells are gifts the sea returns — reminders that every true encounter continues to live within us.

SEVEN OF SHELLS

Heroine: Circe

Keywords: Seduction, enchantment, choice, self-deception, allure of the unknown

Card Description:
Circe stands at the center of a sand-drawn circle, under a full moon night.
Before her, seven shells lie in a crescent. Each reveals a symbolic image:
a cup of wine (pleasure), a snake (danger), a man’s face (attraction), a star (ideal), a mask (illusion), a key (opportunity), a black rose (mystery and loss).
Circe raises her hands in a ritual gesture, her penetrating gaze probing the soul of the observer.
Her dark hair ripples in the wind, intertwined with golden threads.
Behind her, the calm ocean reflects the moonlight — but the waves are frozen, as if time itself were suspended in her spell.

Symbolic Message:
When everything seems possible — stop.
Not every vision is a gift: some lead to confusion, others call you back to your essence.
Circe challenges you to discern between what you truly desire… and what binds you.

EIGHT OF SHELLS

Heroine: Thetis

Keywords: Detachment, release, transformation, emotional passage

Card Description:
Thetis stands alone on a twilight beach.
She wears a long silver gown blending into the foam of the waves, her flowing hair dancing in the wind.
Her gaze is fixed on the horizon, where a ship slowly sails away.
Behind her, eight shells rest on the damp sand: seven arranged in a gentle curve like footprints of the past; the eighth, larger and glowing, lies on the shore, kissed by the tide.
Thetis makes no move to stop the ship, nor does she cry — her composed posture radiates acceptance, though tinged with melancholy.
Above, a silent flock of seagulls glides across the sky.

Symbolic Message:
Thetis embodies the heart that knows when to let go.
The eighth shell, apart from the rest, signals a new cycle beginning.
True love understands the time of release and transformation.
Departure is not loss — it is growth.

NINE OF SHELLS

Heroine: Pasithea

Keywords: Fulfillment, granted desire, pleasure, introspection, delicate balance

Card Description:
Pasithea, nymph of rest and vision, sits on a mother-of-pearl throne floating above a calm, luminous lagoon.
Her dress flows like liquid water, shifting between rose, blue, and silver hues.
Her gaze is gentle and contemplative, fixed on nine shells arranged in a semicircle around her, each floating on the water’s surface.
Some are open, filled with glowing pearls; others remain closed, mysterious.
A soft breeze ripples the lagoon, reminding us that even joy is not static.

Symbolic Message:
Pasithea teaches that contentment brings peace — but may also tempt complacency.
Happiness is real only if the dream remains alive.
Within every fulfillment lies a seed of stagnation or renewal: it is up to us to choose which to nourish.

TEN OF SHELLS

Hero: Eros

Keywords: Joy, fulfilled love, union, celebration, harmony

Card Description:
Eros stands at the center of a garden suspended above the sea, surrounded by golden light.
Bare-chested, with a rose-hued cloak flowing behind him, he smiles gently, eyes on the horizon.
In one hand, he holds a lowered golden bow; in the other, a luminous shell.
Ten pearly shells arranged in a semicircle release waves of light that merge with the sky.
Around him, reconciled mythological lovers dance (subtly visible in the background), immersed in beauty and peace.
In the sky, a soft rainbow links the sea to Olympus — a symbol of celestial union and fulfilled promise.

Symbolic Message:
The Ten of Shells is the card of realized love — of joy that no longer seeks, but gives.
It celebrates the soul that has found its resonance in the world and shares it.
Yet, like all fullness, it poses a question:
Can you cherish beauty… without clinging to it?
