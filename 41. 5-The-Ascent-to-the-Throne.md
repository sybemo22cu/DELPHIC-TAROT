Meaning of the Positions:

1. [Uranus] – The Celestial Origin (top)
What came before me?
What is the ancestral energy that began my inner lineage?
This card represents an ancient, often unconscious influence that guides or conditions from above.

2. [Cronos] – Time and Trial
What have I had to face?
What limiting, paternal, or karmic force has shaped my journey?
Cronos is the devouring time, but also the one who structures: this card reveals the weight or lesson of the past.

3. [Poseidon] – Deep Emotions (left)
What do I feel in the depths?
What is my true emotional nature, my inner sea?
This card unveils the power of emotions, fears, and intuitions.

4. [Zeus] – Conscious Power (right)
How do I act in the world?
What is my present authority, my directional energy?
Zeus represents vision, conscious sovereignty, the mind that governs.

5. [Hades] – The Hidden Realm (bottom)
What is the foundation of my power?
What is my hidden strength — what I’ve transformed or embraced in the depths?
Hades is the throne in the dark, the stability born from shadow acceptance.
