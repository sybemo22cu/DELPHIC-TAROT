General Meaning

The Fool represents the sacred beginning, the leap into the unknown, the pure trust in the calling of destiny.
With Aeneas, the card becomes exodus and vision: he embodies the one who abandons the ruins of the past to follow the mysterious voice of the soul.
It is not madness, but primordial wisdom disguised as naïveté — the courage of one who departs without knowing where he will arrive, driven only by an inner flame.

Keywords: Freedom, Journey, New Beginning, Risk, Innocence, Creative Chaos, Transformation.

Card Description

Aeneas is depicted walking forward, his face turned toward the horizon, one foot suspended over the void of the future.
His light cloak flutters behind him, as if the wind of fate is already guiding him far away.

> "Who abandons everything has already chosen freedom.
And in the lightness of his step, he carries the weight of the world."



On his shoulders, a worn satchel holds the Palladium: a sacred fragment of a ruined past, but also an invisible seed of the future.

A gray wolf walks silently beside him. It trails just behind, its gaze fixed on burning Troy.

> "It neither leads nor follows: it watches.
It is his ancestral instinct that sniffs the ashes and recognizes the origin."



On the devastated ground at the hero’s feet, a sprout emerges: slender, green, unheard.

> "Hope is as silent as a root breaking through stone."



Troy burns behind him: crumbled walls, shattered towers, a crimson sky of farewell.
But ahead, a golden light spreads along the path — asking for no proof, only trust.
