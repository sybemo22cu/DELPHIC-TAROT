THE CUT OF HERMES

One-card spread – Revelation of the Turning Point

Purpose: to receive a clear message from an invisible point in the present — a truth hidden in the middle of the path, between what has been and what is yet to come.


---

When to use it:

when seeking clarity about a situation that feels “in between”

when torn between two directions

as a daily message, drawn from the heart of time



---

Procedure:

1. Hold the deck in your hands and focus inwardly on your question (or open yourself to the message).


2. Shuffle slowly, allowing the flow to settle.


3. Place the deck on the table.


4. With one hand, perform a natural cut: take a portion of the deck and place it to the right.


5. Now take the remaining portion on the left and place it over the one on the right, reassembling the deck.


6. Turn the entire deck face up: the card now at the very bottom (the last) is the voice of Hermes.

Symbolic Note:

This card is the hidden message between two worlds — the knot that binds past and future, action and consequence.
Hermes, lord of thresholds, speaks from there: from the silent heart of transitions.
