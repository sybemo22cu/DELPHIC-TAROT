THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS

Nine-card spread – Inner Harmony

> “Every soul has a melody. But not every string resonates with the same clarity.”




---

The Lyre of Orpheus is a contemplative and profound spread, composed of nine cards laid horizontally — like the nine strings of the lyre gifted to Orpheus by the gods.
In the myth, Apollo gave him a seven-stringed lyre, but Orpheus added two more strings as a gesture of spiritual refinement. This act represents the elevation of human nature toward divine harmony.

The spread explores the depths of the self, shedding light on both visible and invisible forces vibrating within.
Each card is a drawn string: some sound in harmony, others in dissonance — yet all contribute to the unique symphony of your soul.
