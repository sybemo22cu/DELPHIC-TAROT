Two Reading Modes:

1. Open Spread

Shuffle all 78 cards (Major + Minor Arcana).
Draw four cards at random and assign them in order to the four suits.
This version reveals what energy is currently influencing each element of your life.

> Example: If the Hermit appears in the Torch position, your fire may be retreating to search for deeper meaning.



2. Thematic Spread (by suit)

Divide the deck into four separate piles by suit (Torch, Lyre, Shell, Sheaf).
Shuffle each pile individually.
Draw one card per suit, placing each in its corresponding position.
This mode gives a precise archetypal reflection of the dominant energy in each element.

Symbolic Note:

The Sprout of Seeds is a mandala in four directions.
Each card is a leaf unfolding, a flame rising, a wave whispering, a root stretching upward.
What emerges is not just what is happening, but where you are blooming.
